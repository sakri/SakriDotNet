        <h1>Html5 Canvas Workshops</C></h1>
        <p>I give workshops on graphics and animation using the Html5 Canvas at conferences, companies and
            co-working spaces.
            My workshops are hands on, informative and peppered with dry developer humor where
            attendees can expect to absorb information in a relaxed environment. The workshops are basic to medium advanced,
            requiring a working understanding of Javascript.
            The goal of the workshops is a sufficient understanding of the Canvas element, it's
            strengths and weaknesses, for real life application using best practices and insider tricks and tips.
