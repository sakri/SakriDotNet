        <p>Specializing in Visuals, animation and interaction using HTML5 technologies, I enjoy building components,
            data visualizations, uis, games, menus, loaders, mini-sites and other dynamic custom features.

        <p>Coding solo on small projects, participating with teams on larger ones and anything in between works for me.
            I've used too many frameworks and libraries to list, whatever your set up, I can get up to speed and
            productive quickly.</p>
        <p>For smaller projects I'm happy to code Vanilla Javascript (no libs/frameworks). I like Vue.js for mid size,
            I've had good experiences with Angular/Polymer/Typescript as complexity increases.</p>
        <p>I'm a big fan of the Html5 canvas and SVG for lightweight custom features.</p>
        <p>Consulting : Need a technical guy for your brainstorm session? Maybe you have an idea and aren't sure
        which approach to take? Book me for a minimum 4 hours consulting.</p>
