        <p>After graduating Art school in 1999, I started out as a Web Designer and quickly discovered a preference for programming.
            This combination has made me a “visual thinker”, often providing “out of the box” coding solutions and ideas.</p>
        <p>Over the years I have participated in successes and failures, in a range of roles, within teams large and small, various backgrounds,
            cultures and project management processes, making banner ads to large scale web apps, for all types of screens.</p>
        <p>These experiences have molded me into a pragmatist with a mature understanding of the project development life-cycle,
            balancing the requirements of business, designers and developers alike.
            I have been coached and mentored by incredible professionals,
            and have enjoyed sharing that knowledge with others.</p>
        <p>I enjoy brainstorming and problem solving. I'm experienced in project promotion (social media, speaking at events).
            I've pitched projects, give workshops and can communicate technical matters in plain English to non-programmers.
        </p>
        <p>Please take a look at my portfolio for past work, or read my interview style Q&A in the F.A.Q.</p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
        <p>Sakri</p>
